## Mnemom

**Trust but verify.**

Mnemom builds trust infrastructure for AI agents. Every decision an agent makes should be traceable, verifiable, and transparent — not because we distrust the machines, but because trust without evidence isn't trust at all.

### Projects

**[Agent Alignment Protocol (AAP)](https://github.com/mnemom/aap)** — The missing trust layer for the agent stack. An open protocol that gives every AI agent a verifiable record of its decisions, values, and reasoning. Integrates with A2A and MCP.

**[Agent Integrity Protocol (AIP)](https://github.com/mnemom/aip)** — Real-time thinking block analysis for AI agent alignment. AIP analyzes what an agent is thinking before it acts, delivering integrity verdicts between turns. Sister protocol to AAP — same Alignment Card, different timescale.

**[smoltbot](https://github.com/mnemom/smoltbot)** — Transparent AI agent tracing, AAP-compliant. Drop-in observability that captures what your agent thinks, decides, and does — then verifies it against its alignment card.
